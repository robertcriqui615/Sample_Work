# Robert Criqui Work

My name is Robert Criqui, and here are a few pieces of work I've collected across my time in school and at work.

## Python - Data Analysis

1. Artificial Bee Colony.pdf - This was an implementation of the artificial bee colony algorithm I wrote for an optimization class. 
2. Group 7 - Part B - Montclair Housing Data.pdf - This was a project analyzing a dataset of housing information. This was 
for a statistics class where our goal was to transform and clean our data to use for a linear regression model. We then
ran the model to predict housing prices in the town.

## Python

1. dbaccess.py - This was taken from a databse/gui app I wrote for my department. It's a wrapper around the PYODBC module
which allows me to more easily query SQL Server stored procedures.
2. tkcombobox.py - This is taken from the same project. It's an extension of the tkinter ttk Combobox with some added 
methods/properties.


## Tableau

1. Data Visualization Project.twbx - This was taken from my data vizualization class. We had to come up with several different
vizualizations + a dashboard to better represent our data.
